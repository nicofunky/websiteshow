                In September 1998, a series of random suicides leaves Japan baffled and confused. A detective agency specializing in paranormal occurrences picks up on a few similarities while tying to solve the case:<br>
                 All the victims are schoolgirls, and all of them have jumped to their deaths from atop the ancient Fujou Building, a skyscraper that is scheduled to be bulldozed soon.<br><br>

The head of the agency, Touko Aozaki, sends Mikiya Kokutou and Shiki Ryougi to investigate. The kind and surprisingly normal Mikiya serves as a contrast to the cold and mysterious Shiki, who possesses the magical ability "Mystic Eyes of Death Perception" which allows her to see, and bring, an end to all things.
