                In November 1998, a double homicide occurs at the newly constructed Ogawa apartment complex in Mifune City. The murderer, Tomoe Enjou, has fled in a panic. To his astonishment, he is not pursued by the police and news of the incident has not been reported by any media outlets. After Shiki Ryougi saves Tomoe from a group of hostile thugs, she allows him to use her residence as a temporary hideout. A few days later, Tomoe is shocked to discover that his mother is alive and well, even though he knows that he killed her.<br><br>

Coincidentally, Mikiya Kokutou is investigating a tip that Touko Aozaki receives regarding the murder at the apartment complex. As he uncovers more information about the incident, Mikiya takes an interest in Tomoe. Deciding to investigate him further, Mikiya soon discovers the disturbing truth of the Ogawa complex.
