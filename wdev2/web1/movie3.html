                On the night of July 1998, teenager Fujino Asagami is mercilessly raped by a street gang in a dilapidated bar. No matter what physical or sexual abuse they deal, however, the girl regards her captors with the same apathetic expression. The next day, mangled bodies are discovered in the very same building, so torn apart that investigators find it inconceivable to even consider the culprit human..<br><br>

Meanwhile, a client requests Touko Aozaki's detective agency to either capture or kill the perpetrator of last night's incident. Shiki Ryougi is tasked with this duty. Word then spreads that a single survivor escaped the slaughter, and now the murderer is plowing down everything in their path to locate and kill him. A race against time begins, pitting Shiki against a dangerous unknown foe.
