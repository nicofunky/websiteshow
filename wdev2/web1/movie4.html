                Following the events of Murder Speculation part A, Shiki Ryougi has been in a coma for two years due to a traffic accident. When she finally wakes up, she is suprised to find out that she has no memories of her past and is then plagued by a profound loneliness. Even stranger, she notices dark lines drench the things around her, and if she touches them she can disassemble the object: something which completely terrifies her. Her friend, Mikiya Kokutou, enlists the help of Touko Aozaki, a mage who can help Shiki understand what her new eyes: the "Mystic Eyes of Death Perception" are truly capable of and how to use them properly.
