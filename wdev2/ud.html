<hr>
	<p class="p1">
		One project that we did was getting a man by the name of Colm Keegan to work with us for a few weeks. In those classes we learned more on writing. We also have a google doc of all the poems the class has wrote during those weeks. 
		<br><br>
		However, due to me not having permission due to the sensitive topics within the doc from all of the doc contributors to share the doc in its entirety, I will only showcase my own work.

				Krzysztof Gancarz – Filling Space on a Wall. <br><br>
Mental health needs no introduction. It’s the talking point of all institutions these days. <br>
“We care about the mental health of our underlings. We care about them and their worries, their struggles, their issues.”
Stickered over walls and billboards is the same message over and over again: “We care.” <br>
So why don’t we see any changes then? <br>
Everything is still the same. Same shit, different day except the walls are cluttered with supportive sounding words and images. <br>
The support already existed, through the individual, not the organization. <br>
I don’t need the government telling me about how they’re supporting students with changes made to the curriculum that have our mental health in mind. <br>
If I’m having issues, I can go to the sound individuals that I already know. The vice-principle standing near the lockers almost every lunchtime, ready to have a small friendly chat with you or a longer supportive discussion, depending on whatever you brought up first. <br>
He was really approachable. I knew he could help me. And he did. <br>
The empty words on the posters didn’t affect this choice. They might as well have not been there.<br>

			<p>Under the Winter Weather <br><br>

 No light is present. Only artificial rays beam down upon me. <br>

A look out the window is hopeless. Nothing out there can help me. <br>

I don’t want to sit here. This desk is too worn down. <br>

I want to return to my place. My room, shut from all sources of light. <br>

Sure, the rays from the screen may also be artificial.  <br>

The difference is they don’t highlight the questions in front of me.  <br>

I don’t need to face them, they can wait for tomorrow. <br>

I can always just study tomorrow.  <br>

It’s not like I want to now anyways. <br>

…The adventures within the screen await. <br>

The worlds saved, the friends met, the memories obtained.<br>

They’re all there,<br>

Inviting me into their space.<br>

They are the only thing keeping me alive. </p>
